"""Flask blueprint for the dashboard landing page.

Serves the `/` home page and its summary API, showing recent activity, content
metrics, index counts, active workers, and scheduled tasks.

Every number the dashboard publishes is classified on two axes:

* SCOPE - CATALOG (the deduplicated union of every server, i.e. the ``score``
  table) or SERVER (one music server, i.e. ``music_servers`` + the
  ``track_server_map`` rows pointing at it). Nothing is both.
* CADENCE - SNAPSHOT (needs a big query, so it is computed once at startup and
  then hourly into the ``dashboard_stats`` singleton) or LIVE (cheap enough to
  recompute on every poll). Nothing is in between.

Main Features:
* Routes: `/` dashboard page and `/api/dashboard/summary`.
* SNAPSHOT tier: every CATALOG aggregate plus the per-SERVER alignment counts,
  refreshed by ``refresh_dashboard_stats()`` at startup and hourly.
* LIVE tier: workers (Redis), recent tasks and cron (tiny tables) only.

    A server may hold several duplicate FILES of one song (many provider tracks,
    one canonical id), so the counts are split:
      ``unique_songs``     - distinct catalogue songs on the server
                             (COUNT(DISTINCT item_id); the default also counts

    ``server_songs`` is None until the server's catalogue has been counted at

    summary: Aggregated dashboard data - library stats, worker status, recent tasks, cron entries.
    description: |
      Two tiers, and only two. SNAPSHOT: the whole `content` block (every
      CATALOG aggregate plus the per-SERVER alignment counts) is read from the
      precomputed `dashboard_stats` singleton and is NEVER recomputed on a
      request; `stats_updated_at` says when it was taken. LIVE: workers, recent
      tasks and cron are cheap enough to recompute per request; `generated_at`
      says when. A client must not present a LIVE timestamp over SNAPSHOT data.
